**Diversity & Inclusion** 

Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is the practice of creating a workplace where people of all backgrounds feel welcome, valued, and respected. It is an important goal for many businesses because it can lead to a number of benefits, such as increased innovation, improved employee morale, and a better reputation with customers.
Power BI is a business intelligence (BI) tool that can be used to analyze D&I data and identify patterns and trends that can help businesses to improve their D&I efforts.
Some of the metrics that can be analyzed in Power BI to measure D&I include:
Gender diversity: The percentage of men and women in the workforce.
Ethnic diversity: The percentage of people from different ethnic groups in the workforce.
Disability diversity: The percentage of people with disabilities in the workforce.
Power BI can be used to create reports and dashboards that visualize D&I data and help businesses to identify areas where they can improve.
